Inspired by the show I created a cockpit from the show Firefly. 
It included a gas tank full/empty indicator that triggered when the key on the console was turned. 
That action also turned on LED's that marked the status of various areas of the Firefly. 
Trigger and switch combinations played back famous quotes from the show, 
and the entire cockpit included some hidden drawers that had special items related to the show.

The project required 3 Arduinos (i only has two Unos, so I used a Yun which is reflected in one of the files.
